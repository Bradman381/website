          <h1>We help others</h1>
          <p>UPE keeps all students from Berkeley's technical disciplines well-informed of our student activities through intensive marketing over the web and e-mail, print posters, and in-class announcements to the student body.
            UPE engages students with infosessions, tutoring, workshops, and more, making us renowned for our service to the university community.
            We not only reach out to computer science students and faculty, but also the EECS, math, and other engineering majors.</p>
